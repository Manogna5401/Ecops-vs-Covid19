# Ecops-vs-Covid19
An online solution is very useful as the solution is inherently distributive.
Without any fear people or users can lodge a complaint on right time.
People who spot unlawful acts during acts during Covid-19 can report to the control room by signing in our software.
They can attach some pictures or videos or documents as a proof.
Our software is connected with the control room so that they can track the address and transfer the complaint to the respected police station of particular area.
Generation of complaint-id for every complaint that has been lodged is done in our system.
Plans are afoot to embed multi-purpose technologies such as traffic management, mobile data techniques, warrants, personnel scheduling, gang activity analysis, field reporting, human resource development of police personnel, etc.
